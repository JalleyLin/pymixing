# pymixing
## Project description
pymixing is a python audio processing / analysis library based on soundfile, numpy, librosa, and pyloudnorm.Inspired by traditional analog console and digital audio workstations, it aims to provide audio researchers with flexible assistance to deal with the complex audio processing / detection tasks. Currently, pymixing can not only supports the mono files in wav format, but also the stereo files. Besidesï¼Œit is already possible to export the corresponding 48k / 24bit or 44.1k / 16bit wav format mono/stereo audio files as required.
